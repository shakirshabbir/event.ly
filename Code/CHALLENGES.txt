It was interesting point to know that when doing Update, if we send update as it is, it wont do anything and the number of effected rows returned will be 0.
Which infact looks as it is deceiving but actually thats how MYSQL is meant to be.
So do, if $affectedRows!==false # remember it doesnt even works the opposite i.e. $affectedRows === true doesnt works.
